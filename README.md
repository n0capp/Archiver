# archiver based on Huffman-code

implementation of self-written archiver, which used Huffman encoding and decoding. 
Components involved to my code are: 

1)Trie, direct realization of Huffman code. 

2)Bitwise input and output, because in some moments we have to read 9 bits of information 

3)Parser of command line, for comfortable reading

4)Exceptions, in case something went wrong or input data is incorrect

5)Binary heap, which can be easily used as self-written priority queue
